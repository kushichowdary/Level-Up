## ► Project Overview

**Level Up** is a gamified task management application designed to transform your daily habits into an epic adventure. Inspired by the System in the popular manhwa and anime *Solo Leveling*, this app turns mundane tasks into "Daily Quests." By completing these quests, you gain Experience Points (EXP), level up your character, and, most importantly, level up your life.

This isn't just another to-do list. It's a framework for self-improvement, built to motivate and provide a tangible sense of progression. Track your consistency with a detailed heatmap, watch your stats grow, and conquer your real-world goals one quest at a time.

## ✨ Core Features

-   **Status Dashboard:** A central hub displaying your current level, EXP progress bar, and vital statistics like your current streak, longest streak, and total quests completed.
-   **Dynamic Quest System:** Manage both pre-defined "System Quests" (e.g., push-ups, reading) and your own custom "Daily Quests" tailored to your personal goals.
-   **EXP & Leveling Engine:** Each quest awards EXP based on its difficulty. A sophisticated algorithm calculates the EXP required for each new level, ensuring a challenging and rewarding progression curve.
-   **Goal Archive (Heatmap):** A powerful visualization of your journey. The interactive heatmap logs your daily activity, with tooltips providing a detailed breakdown of completed quests and EXP earned on any given day.
-   **Secure Authentication:** Player accounts are powered by Firebase Authentication, ensuring your progress is saved securely.
-   **Immersive UI/UX:** A sleek, dark-themed interface with custom animations and sound effects for completing quests and leveling up, designed to evoke the feeling of a real-life RPG.
-   **Offline Persistence:** Powered by Firestore's local cache, the application is fully functional offline. Your progress will sync automatically once a connection is re-established.
